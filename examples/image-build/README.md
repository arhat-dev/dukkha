# Container Image Build Examples

Build container images using `dukkha` and existing tools (`docker` or `buildah`)

- `dukkha` is built in this way, see [scripts/dukkha/image.yaml](../../scripts/dukkha/image.yaml)
- For relatively complex build examples, see [arhat-dev/dockerfile](https://github.com/arhat-dev/dockerfile)
