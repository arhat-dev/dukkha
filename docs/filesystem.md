# filesystem of dukkha

## Cache Files

Stored in `DUKKHA_CACHE_DIR`

- Intermediate files generated by tasks & renderers
- Files fetched from remote endpoints by renderers

## Special Files in shell scripts

- `/dev/null`: block all read operations, and bypass all write operations

Where you can use these special files:

- `shell` renderer
- `shell` action of `workflow:run` tasks
- template func `eval.Shell`

## Local Files

We recommend using relative paths as much as possible, but when you have to work with absolute path in windows, there are some differences from regular windows paths.

In general, file paths are generalized in unix path style, thus `C:\\some path` should be `/c/some path`
