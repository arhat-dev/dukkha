# S3 Renderer

```yaml
foo@s3: path/to/some-object
```

Render value by downloading s3 object

__NOTE:__ This renderer is disabled by default in favour of `http` renderer, think twice before you really want to use `s3` renderer, you can enable it by building `dukkha` with go build tag `add_renderer_s3`

## Config Options

```yaml
renderers:
- s3:
    # cache config
    cache:
      # enable local cache, disable to always fetch from remote
      enabled: true
      timeout: 1h

    # s3 config
    endpoint_url: https://s3.example.com
    region: ""
    bucket: ""
    # base path used to shorten the value you apply to renderer
    base_path: ""
    access_key_id: my-secret-id
    access_key_secret: my-secret-key
```

## Supported value types

- String: Target object path (when you have configured s3 renderer)

  ```yaml
  foo@s3: object/path
  ```

- Valid s3 fetch spec in yaml

  ```yaml
  foo@s3:
    path: object/path
    config:
      # options are the same as Config Options .renderers.s3
      # but without cache related options
      endpoint_url: https://another-s3.example.com
  ```

## Supported Attributes

- `cached-file`: Return local file path to cached file instead of fetched content.

## Suggested Use Cases

Organization to share build recipes using certral s3 service.
