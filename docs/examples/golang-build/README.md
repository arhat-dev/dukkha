# Golang Build Examples

Build golang projects using `dukkha` and `go` toolchain

- `dukkha` artifacts are built in this way, see [scripts/dukkha/build.yaml](../../../scripts/dukkha/build.yaml)
- For more advanced usage, [golang build config in arhat-dev/credentialfs](https://github.com/arhat-dev/credentialfs/blob/master/scripts/build.yaml) contains cgo cross build example using container images
