To load completions:
bash:

  $ source <(dukkha completion bash)

fish:

  $ dukkha completion fish | source

pwsh (PowerShell):

  PS> dukkha completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

zsh:

  # Enable shell completion
  $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  # Add completion script to one of you $fpath directory
  $ dukkha completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_dukkha"

  NOTE: You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
