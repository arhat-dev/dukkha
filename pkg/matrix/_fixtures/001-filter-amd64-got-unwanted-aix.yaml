# source cause: rs.BaseField.UnmarshalYAML
#  1. using self.unmarshal(yamlKey, v, fSpec.fieldValue, true)
#     fix: changed to self.unmarshal(yamlKey, v, fSpec.fieldValue, false)
#  2. cached data mixed with data resolved from plain yaml data
#     fix: only use cached data when the map field is catch other field
