Make YAML files Makefiles

## The Idea

- Type checked configuration (e.g. workflow definition for github actions)
- Language or tool specific support (e.g. `goreleaser` for go/docker/npm builds)
- Flexible scripting (e.g. Makefile, shell scripts)

A typical build automation tool only take one or two from the above, but we'd take three in `dukkha`!

## Features

- Rendering suffix (`@<renderer>`), get configuration updated dynamically at runtime
- Customizable task matrix execution everywhere
- Shell completion for tools, tasks and task matrix

## Known Limitations

- Rendering suffix:
  - Cannot render the value when applied in yaml file to a map key (in source code), see [#22](https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha/issues/22)
