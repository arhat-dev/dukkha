Make YAML files Makefiles

## Goals

- Type checked configuration (like workflow definitions for github actions)
- Language and tool specific support (like `goreleaser`'s support for go/docker/rpm)
- Flexible scripting (e.g. `Makefile`, shell scripts)
- Content generation and certral management of config recipes. (e.g. `jsonnet`, `cuelang`)

A typical build automation tool only takes one or two from the above at the same time, but we have them all in `dukkha` thanks to the [rendering suffix][rs] support.

## Features

### Content Rendering Features

- Rendering suffix
  - This is the way we make YAML files Makefiles, have a look at [arhat-dev/rs][rs] to familiar yourself with rendering suffix.
  - Renderers like `http`, `env`, `file`, `template` ... are available in dukkha as built-in renderers, see [docs/renderers](./docs/renderers) for more details.

- Available as a cli for custom content rendering, run `dukkha render` over your own yaml docs using rendering suffix.

- Editor support: Autocompletion for dukkha config (including autocompletion of patch spec)
  - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arhat-dev/dukkha/master/docs/generated/schema.json` to your yaml schemas
    - For vscode, add to `yaml.schemas` (for [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#language-server-settings) which is embedded in [`redhat.vscode-yaml`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) plugin)

### Task Execution Features

- Declarative task definition, context aware and customizable tool invocation.
  - Tools know context values of its task execution, and can adapt itself for special case handling like cross compiling.

- Embedded shell environment, you can completely forget external shells with dukkha
  - Predictable command execution made esay, no more worries about when will the environment variables get set, you gain total control.

- Customizable task matrix execution everywhere
  - While matrix values are still limited to strings in order to make them available as environment variables.
  - Command line option `--matrix` (`-m`) for `dukkha run` controls which matrix set is chosen.

  ```yaml
  workflow:run:
  - name: matrix-example
    matrix:
      # add your matrix spec
      kernel: [linux, windows]
      arch: [amd64, arm64]
      my-mat-entry: [foo, bar]

      # and exclude some
      exclude: # `exclude` is reserved
      # match certain matrix entry
      - { kernel: [windows], arch: [amd64] }
      # partial matching is supported as well
      - arch: arm64

      # and include extra matrix, regardless of what `exclude` says
      include: # `include` is reserved field
      - { kernel: [linux], arch: [x86, riscv64] }
      - { kernel: [darwin], arch: [arm64] }
  ```

- Shell completion for tools, tasks and task matrix
  - Run `dukkha completion --help` for instructions

- ANSI escape sequence handling for commands not respecting tty settings to avoid lengthy while meaningless log output (e.g. maven)
  - Automatically enabled when stdout/stderr is not a tty
  - Can be manually enabled by setting flag `--translate-ansi-stream` and `--retain-ansi-style` when running task
  - This functionality is largely based on [`github.com/aoldershaw/ansi`](https://github.com/aoldershaw/ansi)

## How tasks looks?

Here is just a `workflow` task

```yaml
workflow:run:
- name: quick-example
  matrix:
    kernel: [linux]
    arch: [amd64]
  jobs@template:
  # render environment variables before shell evaluation
  - shell@env: |-
      echo ${MATRIX_KERNEL}/{{ matrix.arch }}
  # run shell script from http server
  - shell@template|http: |-
      https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arhatbot/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      d1f27e2b6d7e41a7c9d0a6ef7e39a921/raw/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      1e014333a3d78ac1139bc4cab9a68685e5080685/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      echo.sh
```

__NOTE:__ You can find more [examples here](./docs/examples)

## Installation

### Build from source (not stripped)

- Option 1: Build directly with `go` 1.16+

  ```bash
  export VERSION=latest
  go get -u arhat.dev/dukkha/cmd/dukkha@${VERSION}
  ```

- Option 2: Clone and build with `make` and `go` 1.16+

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha.git
  cd dukkha
  # checkout branch or commit as you prefer
  make dukkha
  # then you can find the built executable in build/dukkha
  ```

### Download Pre-built Executables

Before you start, set what version you would like to download

```bash
# set dukkha version
export VERSION=latest
# set to your host kernel (same as GOOS value)
export KERNEL=linux
# set to your host arch (slightly different from GOARCH, see ./docs/constants.md)
export ARCH=amd64
```

__NOTE:__ Combinations of `KERNEL` and `ARCH` are available at [scripts/dukkha/build-matrix.yml](./scripts/dukkha/build-matrix.yml)

- Option 1: Download and verify signature of dukkha using [`sget`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)

```bash
sget --key https://arhat.dev/.well-known/cosign.pub -o dukkha \
  "ghcr.io/arhat-dev/dist/dukkha:${VERSION}-${KERNEL}-${ARCH}"
chmod +x dukkha
```

- Option 2: Download pre-built artifacts from [releases](https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha/releases)

## Further Thoughts

As you may have noticed, the core of `dukkha` is the rendering suffix, we have more thoughts on the usage of rendering suffix as it dramatically eases the management of yaml config:

- Extend dukkha to be something like `systemd` for system configration and process management
- Manage kubernetes manifests in GitOps pipeline
- Infrastructure as Config instead of Infrastructure as Code
