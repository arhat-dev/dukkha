Make YAML files Makefiles

## Quick Example

```yaml
workflow:run:
- name: quick-example
  matrix:
    kernel: [linux]
    arch: [amd64]
  # render inner go templates
  jobs@template:
  # render environment variables before shell evaluation
  - shell@env: |-
      echo ${MATRIX_KERNEL}/{{ .Env.MATRIX_ARCH }}
  # run shell script from http server
  - shell@template|http: |-
      https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arhatbot/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      d1f27e2b6d7e41a7c9d0a6ef7e39a921/raw/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      1e014333a3d78ac1139bc4cab9a68685e5080685/{{- /* line join */ -}}
      echo.sh
```

__NOTE:__ You can find more live examples [examples](./examples)

## Goals

- Type checked configuration (like workflow definitions for github actions)
- Language and tool specific support (like `goreleaser` support for go/docker/rpm builds)
- Flexible scripting in yaml files (e.g. `Makefile`, shell scripts)
- Content generation and certral management of config recipes

A typical build automation tool only take one or two from the above, but we'd take all in `dukkha`!

## Non-Goals

- To replace any existing tool
  - `dukkha` only wraps other tools for common use cases to ease your life with devops pipelines
- To build a custom cli tool to support all kinds of tasks

## Features

### Content Rendering Features

Please refer to [docs/rendering](./docs/rendering.md) for more details

- Rendering suffix: get configuration rendered dynamically at runtime
  - Just `@some-renderer` in your yaml field key

  ```yaml
  # environment variable FOO will be expanded and its value is used to set
  # `foo` field
  foo@env: ${FOO}
  ```

- Renderer chaning: Combine multiple renderers to achieve even more flexibility.
  - Chain your renderers with pipe symbol `|`

  ```yaml
  # in the following yaml example, dukkha will render the content three times
  #   1. (http) Fetch content from remote http server as specified by the url
  #   2. (template) Execute the fetched content as a go template
  #   3. (env) Expand environment variables in the resulted data
  foo@http|template|env: https://example.com/foo.yaml
  ```

- Patching and merging: Combine multiple yaml documents into one
  - Append suffix `!` to existing rendering suffix

  ```yaml
  foo@http!: # notice the suffix `!`
    # value for this renderer (http)
    value: https://example.com/bar.yaml
    # merge other yaml docs
    merge:
    - data@file: ./foo.yaml
    - data: [plain, yaml]
    # json patch (rfc6902) in yaml format
    patches:
    - { op: add, path: /a/b/c, value: foo }
  ```

- Available as a cli for custom content rendering
  - Run `dukkha render` over your own yaml docs using rendering suffix

### Task Execution Features

- Customizable task matrix execution everywhere

```yaml
workflow:run:
- name: matrix-example
  matrix:
    # add your matrix spec
    kernel: [linux, windows]
    arch: [amd64, arm64]

    # and exclude some
    exclude: # `exclude` is reserved
    # match certain matrix
    - kernel: [windows]
      arch: [amd64]
    # partial matching is supported as well
    - arch: arm64

    # and include extra matrix
    include: # `include` is reserved field
    - kernel: [linux]
      arch: [x86, riscv64]
    - kernel: [darwin]
      arch: [arm64]
```

- Shell completion for tools, tasks and task matrix
  - Run `dukkha completion --help` for instructions

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
make dukkha
```

### Download Pre-built Executables

Before you start, set what version you would like to download

```bash
# set dukkha version
export VERSION=latest
# set to your host kernel (same as GOOS value)
export KERNEL=linux
# set to your host arch (slightly different from GOARCH, see ./docs/constants.md)
export ARCH=amd64
```

__NOTE:__ Combinations of `KERNEL` and `ARCH` are available at [scripts/dukkha/build-matrix.yml](./scripts/dukkha/build-matrix.yml)

- Option 1: Download and verify signature of dukkha using [`sget`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)

```bash
sget -key https://arhat.dev/.well-known/cosign.pub -o dukkha \
  "ghcr.io/arhat-dev/dist/dukkha:${VERSION}-${KERNEL}-${ARCH}"
chmod +x dukkha
```

## Further Thoughts

As you may have noticed, the core of `dukkha` is the rendering suffix, we have more toughts on the usage of rendering suffix as it dramatically eases the management of yaml config:

- Extend dukkha to be something like `systemd` for system configration and process management
- Manage kubernetes manifests in GitOps pipeline
- Infrastructure as Config instead of Infrastructure as Code
