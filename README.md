Make YAML files Makefiles

## Goals

- Type checked configuration (e.g. workflow definition for github actions)
- Language and tool specific support (e.g. `goreleaser` for go/docker/npm builds)
- Flexible scripting (e.g. `Makefile`, shell scripts)

A typical build automation tool only take one or two from the above, but we'd take three in `dukkha`!

## Non-Goals

- To replace any existing tool
  - `dukkha` only wraps other tools for common use cases to ease your life with devops pipelines
- To build a custom cli tool to support all kinds of tasks

## Features

- Rendering suffix, get configuration updated dynamically at runtime
  - Just `@some-renderer` in your yaml field key
    - e.g. `foo@env: ${FOO}` will expand all referenced the environment variable
  - Also supports renderer chaning
    - e.g. `foo@http|template|env` first to fetch content from remote http server, then execute it as a go template, and finally expand environment variables in the resulted data
- Flexible yet strict typing, not always string value for renderer input
  - Some Renderer can accept any kind of value to keep your yaml file highlighted as it should be
- Customizable task matrix execution everywhere
- Shell completion for tools, tasks and task matrix

```yaml
workflow:run:
- name@env: ${WORKFLOW_NAME}
  matrix:
    kernel: [linux]
    arch: [amd64]
  jobs@template:
  - shell@env: |-
      echo ${MATRIX_KERNEL}/{{ .Env.MATRIX_ARCH }}
  - shell@template|http: |-
