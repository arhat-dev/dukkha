Make YAML files Makefiles

## Goals

- Type checked configuration (like workflow definitions for github actions)
- Language and tool specific support (like `goreleaser`'s support for go/docker/rpm)
- Flexible scripting (e.g. `Makefile`, shell scripts)
- Content generation and certral management of config recipes. (e.g. `jsonnet`, `cuelang`)

A typical build automation tool only takes one or two from the above at the same time, but we have them all in `dukkha` thanks to the [rendering suffix][rs] support.

## Features

### Content Rendering Features

- Rendering suffix: extremely extensible & dynamic but type checked config wherever you want.
  - This is the way we make YAML files Makefiles, have a look at [arhat-dev/rs][rs] to familiar yourself with rendering suffix.
  - Renderers like `http`, `env`, `file`, `tpl` ... are available in dukkha as built-in renderers, see [docs/renderers](./docs/renderers) for more details.
  - In addition to basic renderer support, we have renderer attributes (`@<renderer>#<attr>`) to produce different kind of result
    - A common use case of this feature is to reuse renderer `http`: by default it returns the content fetched from remote endpoint, but when applied with attribute `cached-file` as `http#cached-file`, it will produce local file path to the cached content.

- Available as a cli for custom content rendering, run `dukkha render` over your own yaml docs using rendering suffix.

- Editor support: Autocompletion for dukkha config (including autocompletion of patch spec)
  - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arhat-dev/dukkha/master/docs/generated/schema.json` to your yaml schemas
    - For vscode, add to `yaml.schemas` (for [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#language-server-settings) which is embedded in [`redhat.vscode-yaml`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) plugin)

### Task Execution Features

- Declarative task definition, context aware tool invocation.
  - Tools have access to task related values, and can adapt itself for all use cases (e.g. cross compiling).

- Embedded cross-platform bash environment, you can completely forget external shells with dukkha
  - Predictable command execution made esay, gain full control on when and how the arguments get evaluated.

  __NOTE:__ You can still use external shells as long as you configure them in `shells` section.

- Matrix execution for every task
  - Use command line option `--matrix` (`-m`) to control which vectors are chosen.

  __NOTE:__ Vectors are currently limited to string values.

- Shell completion for defined tools, tasks and task matrix
  - Run `dukkha completion --help` for instructions

- ANSI escape sequence handling for commands not respecting tty settings to avoid lengthy while meaningless log output (e.g. maven)
  - Automatically enabled when stdout/stderr is not a tty
  - Can be manually enabled by setting flag `--translate-ansi-stream` and `--retain-ansi-style` when running task
  - This functionality is largely based on [`github.com/aoldershaw/ansi`](https://github.com/aoldershaw/ansi)

__NOTE:__ You can find more details in [docs](./docs)

## How it looks?

see [docs/examples](./docs/examples)

## Installation

### Build from source (not stripped)

Clone and build with `make` and `go` 1.17+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha.git
cd dukkha
# checkout branch or commit as you prefer
make dukkha
```

Then you can find the built executable at `./build/dukkha`

### Download Pre-built Executables

- Option 1: Download and verify signature of dukkha using [`sget`][sget]

  ```bash
  # set dukkha version
  export VERSION=latest
  # set to your host kernel (same as GOOS value)
  export KERNEL=linux
  # set to your host arch (slightly different from GOARCH, see ./docs/constants.md)
  export ARCH=amd64

  sget --key https://arhat.dev/.well-known/cosign.pub -o dukkha \
    "ghcr.io/arhat-dev/dist/dukkha:${VERSION}-${KERNEL}-${ARCH}"
  chmod +x dukkha
  ```

  __NOTE:__ Please refer to [arhat-dev/dukkha-presets golang common matrix](https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha-presets/blob/dev/matrix/golang/1.17/common.yml) for `KERNEL` and `ARCH` values

- Option 2: Download signed artifacts from [releases](https://github.com/arhat-dev/dukkha/releases), then decompress the tarball/zipfile.

## Further Thoughts

As you may have noticed, the core of `dukkha` is the rendering suffix, we have more thoughts on the usage of rendering suffix as it dramatically eases the management of yaml config:

- Extend dukkha to be something like `systemd` for system configration and process management
- Manage kubernetes manifests in GitOps pipeline
- Infrastructure as Config instead of Infrastructure as Code
